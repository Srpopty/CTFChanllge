From the hag and hungry goblin
That into rags would rend ye
The spirit that stands by the naked man
In the Book of Moons defend ye
That of your five sound senses
You never be forsaken
Nor wander from your selves with Tom
Abroad to beg your bacon
While I do sing Any food any feeding
Feeding drink or clothing
Come dame or maid be not afraid
Poor Tom will injure nothing
Of thirty bare years have I
Twice twenty been enraged
And of forty been three times fifteen
In durance soundly caged
On the lordly lofts of Bedlam
With stubble soft and dainty
Brave bracelets strong sweet whips ding dong
With wholesome hunger plenty
And now I sing Any food any feeding
Feeding drink or clothing
Come dame or maid be not afraid
Poor Tom will injure nothing
With a thought I took for Maudlin
And a cruse of cockle pottage
With a thing thus tall sky bless you all
I befell into this dotage
I slept not since the Conquest
Till then I never waked
Till the roguish boy of love where I lay
Me found and stript me naked
While I do sing Any food any feeding
Feeding drink or clothing
Come dame or maid be not afraid
Poor Tom will injure nothing
When I short have shorn my sows face
And swigged my horny barrel
In an oaken inn I pound my skin
As a suit of gilt apparel
The moons my constant mistress
And the lovely owl my marrow
The flaming drake and the night crow make
Me music to my sorrow
While I do sing Any food any feeding
Feeding drink or clothing
Come dame or maid be not afraid
Poor Tom will injure nothing
The palsy plagues my pulses
When I prig your pigs or pullen
Your culvers take or matchless make
Your Chanticleer or Sullen
When I want provant with Humphry
I sup and when benighted
I repose in Pauls with waking souls
Yet never am affrighted
But I do sing Any food any feeding
Feeding drink or clothing
Come dame or maid be not afraid
Poor Tom will injure nothing
I know more than Apollo
For oft when he lies sleeping
I see the stars at mortal wars
In the wounded welkin weeping
The moon embrace her shepherd
And the Queen of Love her warrior
While the first doth horn the star of morn
And the next the heavenly Farrier
While I do sing Any food any feeding
Feeding drink or clothing
Come dame or maid be not afraid
Poor Tom will injure nothing
The Gypsies Snap and Pedro
Are none of Toms comradoes
The punk I scorn and the cutpurse sworn
And the roaring boys bravadoes
The meek the white the gentle
Me handle not nor spare not
But those that cross Tom Rynosseross
Do what the panther dare not
Although I sing Any food any feeding
Feeding drink or clothing
Come dame or maid be not afraid
Poor Tom will injure nothing
With an host of furious fancies
Whereof I am commander
With a burning spear and a horse of air
To the wilderness I wander
By a knight of ghosts and shadows
I summoned am to tourney
Ten leagues beyond the wide worlds end
Methinks it is no journey
Yet I will sing Any food any feeding
Feeding drink or clothing
Come dame or maid be not afraid
Poor Tom will injure nothing
